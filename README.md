# Data Science and Analytics

### Technology

* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/whatisnumpy.html): a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html): pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.
* [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): Simple and efficient open source tools for predictive data analysisthat is accessible to everybody, and reusable in various contexts. Built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib.
